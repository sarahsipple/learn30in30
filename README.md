Challenge for myself to complete 30 websites in 30 days. I have been learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and accompanying technologies and want to create projects I can use for a portfolio to be hired. 

Goals of this challenge: 
Fast Execution - By completing a project a day, I have to work fast and cannot allow myself to get stuck on small things. 
Have a higher quantity of projects to show potential employers.
Avoid perfectionist traps and distraction by having a harsh deadline, even if self-imposed.
Show consistent progress - with daily work I hope to improve my knowledge and abilities over the course of the next 30 days.
